**Intel Outside** is a Perplexity-Inspired LLM Answer Engine

-----

## 📖 Overview

**Intel Outside** contains the code and instructions needed to build a sophisticated answer engine that leverages the capabilities of [Groq](https://www.groq.com/), [Mistral AI's Mixtral](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/), [Langchain.JS](https://js.langchain.com/docs/), [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com/), [Serper API](https://serper.dev/), and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). Designed to efficiently return sources, answers, images, videos, and follow-up questions based on user queries, this project is an ideal starting point for developers interested in natural language processing and search technologies.

## 🛠️ Tools 

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **Vercel AI SDK**: The Vercel AI SDK is a library for building AI-powered streaming text and chat UIs.
- **Groq & Mixtral**: Technologies for processing and understanding user queries.
- **Langchain.JS**: A JavaScript library focused on text operations, such as text splitting and embeddings.
- **Brave Search**: A privacy-focused search engine used for sourcing relevant content and images.
- **Serper API**: Used for fetching relevant video and image results based on the user's query.
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: Used for creating vector representations of text chunks.
- **Cheerio**: Utilized for HTML parsing, allowing the extraction of content from web pages.

## 🎛️ Key Features

- **Customizable Agent Roles**: Define roles like CEO, virtual assistant, developer, etc., and customize their functionalities with [Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview).
- **Full Control Over Prompts**: Avoid conflicts and restrictions of pre-defined prompts, allowing full customization.
- **Tool Creation**: Tools within Agency Swarm are created using [Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor), which provides a convenient interface and automatic type validation. 
- **Efficient Communication**: Agents communicate through a specially designed "send message" tool based on their own descriptions.
- **State Management**: Agency Swarm efficiently manages the state of your assistants on OpenAI, maintaining it in a special `settings.json` file.

## 📍 Roadmap

- Asynchronous communication and task handling
- Creation of agencies that can autonomously create other agencies
- Inter-agency communication for a self-expanding system
